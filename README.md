Smooth Zoom is a simple lightweight Lua mod for the game Teardown, that adds the ability to zoom your field of view in and out.

Smooth Zoom currently has these features:

- Adjustable Zoom amount
- Adjustable zoom speed
- Rebindable key binds
- Zoom mode's (hold or toggle)
- Scroll zoom
- Allow zooming in while in a vehicle
- Hides hud while zooming
- Options menu
- In game options menu

## Why Make This?

Other block games (Minecraft) have had zoom mods made for them, for example the [Zoomify](https://modrinth.com/mod/zoomify) mod for Minecraft. When I created this mod, Teardown didn't have anything like this so I decided to try and make one.
